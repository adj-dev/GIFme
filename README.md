## _Search and download millions of GIFs_

GIFme uses the GIPHY database to provide the user a limitless amount of gifs to search through. 

When the page first renders a preset list of _topics_ automatically appear as tags the user can click. Clicking a __tag__ will generate 10 gifs related to the topic of that tag. Additionally, more gifs can be loaded by scrolling to the bottom of the page and clicking on the __MORE +__ button. 

Tags can be removed by clicking on the small "x" that appears in the upper-right corner of the green box when you hover over a tag. 

The application will block duplicate tags from being submitted.
